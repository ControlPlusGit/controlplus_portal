/* This is an example describing the streaming communication between
   a PC Host and a microchip device using USB HID for transporting
   the streaming packets.

   If you do not use USB HID but some other protocol your byte stream
   will look different in point 3.
   
   Point 3. was added to show a full stack.


    =============================================================================

    From Host to Device:

    ------------------------------------------------------

    On the physical line the following byte-stream is seen: 

    Byte 0    1        2         3         4         5         6         7      8            (8 + tx-prot) (9+tx-prot) (10+tx-prot)                
    +------+-------+-------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------...---+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------
    | TID  |payload|re-    | protocol | tx-prot | tx-prot | rx-prot | rx-prot | data        | protocol B  | tx-prot B | tx-prot B |                
    |      |       | served|          |  MSB    |  LSB    |   MSB   |   LSB   |             |             |    MSB    |   LSB     |
    +------+-------+-------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------...---+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------

    TID = the transaction ID is changed with every report sent.
    payload = the amount of data in this report (sent from host to device) - a packet can be longer than
              this size (i.e. the packet is sent with several reports - note *)
    tx-prot = number of bytes transmitted (for this protocol packet) from host to device
    rx-prot = number ob bytes expected to be received (for this protocol packet) from device

    *) if a packet cannot be sent in one report the next report will not have the "protocol header" set again,
    but continue with the raw data. 


    This bytestream is build through the following 3 steps:

    ------------------------------------------------------

    1. The AmsComObject class provides a single data packet:

        Byte 0         1   ...                   tx-size -1
    +------------+-------- ... ----------------------------+
    |   data                                               |
    +--------------------- ... ----------------------------+


    ------------------------------------------------------

    2. The stream driver on the Host side takes a single data packet and adds the protocol header :

    Byte 0         1          2         3        4          5                                   4 + tx-size
    +------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------------------------- ... ------------------+
    | protocol   | tx-prot | tx-prot | rx-prot | rx-prot |  data                                           |
    |            |  MSB    |  LSB    |  MSB    |  LSB    |                                                 |
    +------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------------------------- ... ------------------+
    ^                                                    ^
    |                                                    |
    +----- this is the protocol header ------------------+

    ^                                                                                                      ^
    |                                                                                                      |
    +----this is given to the HID driver as a single packet -----------------------------------------------+
         

    Steps 1. and 2. can be repeated several times for sending more than 1 packet in a single HID report.

    ------------------------------------------------------

    3. The Hid driver on the Host side adds for each Hid Report (the following report header):

    a) if the data-buffer fits in one HID-report:

    Byte 0      1     2       3                 2+ payload         ....       63
    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | TID  |payload|res.  | packet(s)                      | padding if necessary  | 
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+
    ^                     ^
    |                     |
    +---------------------+
    this is the HID
     driver header

    b) if the packet(s) need more than 1 HID-report

    Byte 0      1     2       3                                    ....       63
    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | TID  |payload|res.  | packet(s)                                              | 
    |      | = 61  |      |                                                        |
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+
		           
    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | new  |payload|res.  | packet(s)                                              | 
    | TID  | = 61  |      |      continued                                         |
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+

    .... as many HID reports as needed until the packet(s) are totally
         transmitted (here is how the final report might look like):

    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | next |payload|res.  | packet(s)                      | padding if necessary  | 
    | TID  | <= 61 |      |      continued                 |                       |
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+

/*  =============================================================================

    From Device to Host:

    ------------------------------------------------------

    On the physical line the following byte-stream is seen: 

    Byte 0    1        2         3         4         5         6         7      8            (8 + tx-prot) (9+tx-prot) (10+tx-prot)

    TID = the transaction ID is reflected th every report sent.
    payload = the amount of data in this report (sent from host to device) - a packet can be longer than
              this size (i.e. the packet is sent with several reports - note *)
    HID status = if a protocol was not processed (because e.g. the protocol id was unknown) the next HID
              packet that is sent back will contain a HID status byte <> 0 indicating that an error 
              occurred (some time in the back).
    protocol status = a single byte representing the result of the command if the command generated either data to
              be sent back or is a read command (has the MSBit cleared)
    tx-prot = number of bytes transmitted (for this protocol packet) from device to host

    *) if a packet cannot be sent in one report the next report will not have the "protocol header" set again,
    but continue with the raw data. 


    This bytestream is build by through the following 3 steps:

    ------------------------------------------------------

    1. The Firmware-Application provides a single data packet containing the result:

	        Byte 0         1   ...                   tx-size -1
    +------------+-------- ... ----------------------------+
    |   data                                               |
    +--------------------- ... ----------------------------+

	2. The function processReceivedPackets of file stream_appl_handler.c in the firmware adds the protocol byte,
       the reserved and the status byte and the tx-prot 16-bit word (from the information provided by the 
	   firmware application):

    Byte 0         1          2         3        4          5                                   4 + tx-size
    +------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------------------------- ... ------------------+
    | protocol   | reserved| status  | tx-prot | tx-prot |  data                                           |
    |            |         |         |  MSB    |  LSB    |                                                 |
    +------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------------------------- ... ------------------+
    ^                                                    ^
    |                                                    |
    +----- this is the protocol header ------------------+


    Steps 1. and 2. can be repeated several times before handing a single buffer (containing all packets) 
	to the HID driver.

    ------------------------------------------------------

    3. The Hid driver on the Device side splits the buffer into Hid Reports and adds for each Hid Report 
       (the following report header):

    a) if the data-buffer fits in one HID-report:

    Byte 0      1      3       4                 3+ payload         ....       63
    +------+-------+-------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | TID  |payload|status | packet(s)                      | padding if necessary  | 
    +------+-------+-------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+
    ^                      ^
    |                      |
    +----------------------+
    this is the HID
     driver header

    b) if the packet(s) need more than 1 HID-report

    Byte 0      1     2       3                                    ....       63
    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | TID  |payload|status| packet(s)                                              | 
    |      | = 61  |      |                                                        |
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+
		           
    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | new  |payload|status| packet(s)                                              | 
    | TID  | = 61  |      |      continued                                         |
    +------+-------+------+----------+---...-+-------------+-------.... -----------+

    .... as many HID reports as needed until the packet(s) are totally
         transmitted (here is how the final report might look like):

    +------+-------+------+----------+---... +-------------+-------     -----------+
    | next |payload|status| packet(s)                      | padding if necessary  | 
    | TID  | <= 61 |      |      continued                 |                       |

/*  =============================================================================
    TID-Rules:

    On the host side, the TID is generated as a 4-bit number counting from 0 to 0x0F 
    and than rolling over to 0. 

    The device side takes the TID received from the Host and moves it to the upper
    nibble, increments its own TID counter by one (range is again 0 to 0x0F) and 
    adds its own TID counter.
